# Reinforcment Learning

## I want to learn to use RL to train a flappy bird to play itslef and learn in a env game


**In RL(Reinforcement Learning) we need to have a envrioemnt for example
the flappy bird game I want to make the bird flap and pass the pipes on its own* *


## 1. Environment Setup
- Create or adapt a Flappy Bird game environment
- Define observation space (what the agent can "see")
- Define action space (jump or don't jump)
- Set up reward structure (positive for surviving, negative for crashing)
